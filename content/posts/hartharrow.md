Hartharrow is a coastal village of about 400 in northern Carse.

Primarily a fishing village, Hartharrow also has ample forested areas nearby that provides decent hunting and trapping for the populace. The soil around the village is not as rocky as that nearer to Rock Ridge, so it supports a varied selection of crops for farming. In fact, the town was renamed after local's invention of a harrow that utilized hart antlers to break up the still reasonably tough soil of the region.
